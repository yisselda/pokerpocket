> deal
> skipbet             # Skip pre-flop betting (all players check/call)
> flop
> skipbet             # Skip flop betting

> showdown            # See results
```

## Engine API

Use the engine in your own projects:

```typescript
import { newGame, evaluate7, drawRandom } from 'pokerpocket'

// Quick game with helper function
const game = newGame({ players: 6, seed: 12345 })
game.deal()
game.flop()
game.turn()
game.river()

// Get results
const { results, winners } = game.showdown()
console.log(
  'Winners:',
  winners.map(w => `P${w + 1}`)
)

// Direct hand evaluation
const cards = [
  { rank: 'A', suit: 's' },
  { rank: 'K', suit: 's' },
  { rank: 'Q', suit: 's' },
  { rank: 'J', suit: 's' },
  { rank: 'T', suit: 's' },
  { rank: '2', suit: 'h' },
  { rank: '3', suit: 'h' },
]
const result = evaluate7(cards)
console.log(result.rank) // 'STRAIGHT_FLUSH'

// Random card generation
const randomHand = drawRandom(7) // Get 7 random cards
const handResult = evaluate7(randomHand)
console.log(`Random hand: ${handResult.rank}`)
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Development CLI
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **types.ts** - Type definitions for cards, hands, and results
- **rng.ts** - Seedable Linear Congruential Generator
- **deck.ts** - 52-card deck with Fisher-Yates shuffle and random card utilities
- **evaluator.ts** - 7‚Üíbest-5 hand evaluation with tie-breaking
- **engine.ts** - Game state management and flow control
- **cli.ts** - Interactive command-line interface

### Hand Evaluation

The evaluator uses a brute-force approach, checking all 21 possible 5-card combinations from 7 cards and selecting the best. Each hand gets a BigInt score for deterministic comparison:

```
score = (rank_code << 40) | (tie1 << 32) | (tie2 << 24) | (tie3 << 16) | (tie4 << 8) | tie5
```

This ensures proper ordering with no ambiguity in tie-breaking.
